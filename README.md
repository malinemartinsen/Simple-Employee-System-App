# Employee-application

Clock in, clock out and search Java-application for employees in a firm.

## Language

This application is written with Java, and is the first project I have made with Java, which means that the language is basic (and native).

The project includes three different .java-documents:

- main (where the code is executed from)
- employee (the blueprint for the employee objects)
- employer (the class gathering the employee objects)

## Meaning behind the app

The purpose of the app is to illustrate an environment where the employee can (with security questions, due to privacy) clock in and out from work, as well as look up their own information as well as coworkers. Considering this is the first app written in java, it's a very simple app without any database or gui.

## Prospective updates

With further work on this app, an idea is to add gui as well as to have the coworkers in a database (and not in the code itself), considering this type of information normally is sensitive.
